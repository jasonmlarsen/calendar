# Calendar

99.9% of the work is from Adam Newbold at <https://neatnik.net>. 

This is a simple calendar with the full year on a single page. Designed to be printed, it will automatically adjust to any paper size or direction (though it looks best in landscape orientation).

By default, the current year is used. You can override the year by supplying a year parameter, e.g. <https://jasonmlarsen.com/calendar/?year=2027>.

You can also switch to a weekday-aligned rendering by setting the layout parameter value to aligned-weekdays, <https://jasonmlarsen.com/calendar/?layout=aligned-weekdays>

My adjustment... start on any month of the year, <https://jasonmlarsen.com/calendar/?startmonth=jan>.
